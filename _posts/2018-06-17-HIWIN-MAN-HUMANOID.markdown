In the past, humanoid robots have been studied for decades by a lot of research groups. Researchers at Waseda University started the humanoid robot research since 1966, and they developed a biped humanoid robot WABIAN-2R1. The WABIAN-2R is developed to imitate the human motion. The walking experiments are based on an online pattern generation obtained by the visual and auditory information.2 Honda Corporation developed humanoid robots named Asimo. The newest Asimo has 34 DOFs, 130 cm height, and 54 kg weight. The control method of Asimo is using the zero moment point to plan the pre-recorded joint trajectories and play them back with sensor-based compliant control.3 Sony Corporation also developed several compact size humanoid robots named QRIO. QRIO has 38 DOFs, 58 cm height, and 7.3 kg weight.4 The Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and Kawada Industries, Inc., have jointly developed HRP-2 from 1998. HRP-2 can walk, lie down, get up, open a door and through a door.5 HRP-2 has 30 DOFs, 154 cm height, and 58 kg weight. Beijing Institute of Technology also developed a humanoid robot called BHR-03, and this robot is characterized by its light weight construction.6 BHR-02 has 32 DOFs, 160 cm height, and 63 kg weight. Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology developed KHR-3 humanoid (HUBO).7 HUBO has 41 DOFs, 125 cm height, and 55 kg weight. Although the robot has been investigated for many years, it still has many issues to be studied, especially in the humanoid robot area.14-16 In this paper, a small-size humanoid robot called HIWIN MAN is developed. The objective of developing HIWIN MAN is to build a platform to investigate the walking gait generation and other artificial intelligence


<h2 >Structure Design </h2><br>The main design purposes are lightweight and robust so that HIWIN MAN can sustain the high speed movement. The actuators of the HIWIN MAN are fabricated from ROBOTIS. Three actuators are adopted on HIWIN MAN.In the implementation of the head and arms of HIWIN MAN, Ax-18a and Rx-28 actuators are used to reduce the weight of the upper body. In the implementation of the waist, trunk and legs of HIWIN MAN, Rx-28 and Rx-64 actuators with a higher torque are used to let the robot have a higher power.


 <h2>Mechanical Design </h2><br> It has 23 DOFs and 2 DOFs on the head, 1 DOF in the waist, 4 DOFs on each arm, and 6 DOFs on each leg.the developments of the head, arms, waist, trunk and legs are presented as follow:
 Head The mechanical design of head is to increase the view of the webcam on the HIWIN MAN. There are 2 DOFs to increase two dimension of the webcam.
Waist The mechanical design of the waist is for the fall down. There is 1 DOF in the waist
Legs The mechanical design of the legs are for imitate the human walking motion. There are 6 DOFs in each leg.
 Arms The mechanical design of the arms is for manipulation the object. There are 4 DOFs in each arm.
